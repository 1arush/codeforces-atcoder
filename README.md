# codeforces-atcoder
Contains the codes of some solved problems from codeforces and atcoder.
I've solved 1400 of them (yikes!)

Initially, the purpose of this repository was to monitor my solving strategies and their timeline. 
However, recently it has become more about keeping mementos of problems that I enjoyed and learned 
from. I hope to keep this repository alive as long as possible.
